# 1. create two empty matrices, L and U, that are the same size as A
# 2. set the value of the diagonal of U to 1
# 3. for each row k in A:
# 4.     for each column j in A:
# 5.         if j<k:
# 6.             set L[j,k] equal to the sum of [L[j,s]*U[s,k] for s from 0 to k-1]
# 7.         if j>k:
# 8.             set U[k,j] equal to [A[k,j]-sum([L[k,s]*U[s,j] for s from 0 to k-1])]/L[k,k]
# 9. print L
# 10. print U
# 11. return L and U
