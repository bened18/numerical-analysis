input: function, starting value, interval size, maximum number of iterations

output: iteration, table, change of sign

iteration = 1;
x1 = x0 + interval size;                               
mp =  f(x0) * f(x1);        #check if there is a change of sign
    
if mp <0 then there is a change of sign
    the interval entered [x0,x1] has a root

while (iteration<=itermax):      
        
    print("iteration" , iteration, "[",x0,",",x1,"]", "f(x) =", mp) 
        
    if mp<0:
        the interval with possible root is [x0,x1] 
        break
        
    x0 = x1                  update the interval                       
    x1 = x0 + delta          update the delta  
    mp = f(x0) * f(x1)
