#Create an array for the x-values of the data points
#Create an array for the y-values of the data points
#Create an empty array for the y-values of the polynomial
#For each x-value in the x-values array:
#    Create an empty array for the terms
#    For each y-value in the y-values array:
#        Create a term
#        Set the term equal to the y-value times the product of all the x-values except the current x-value divided by the difference between the x-value and all the other x-values except the current x-value
#        Add the term to the terms array
#    Set the y-value of the corresponding x-value in the polynomial array equal to the sum of all the terms in the terms array
#Plot the data points and the polynomial
