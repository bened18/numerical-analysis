input: function, interval a, interval b, tolerance, maximum number of iterations 

output: table with iteration number, intervals, midpoint and result

if f(a)*f(b) is greater than or equal to zero then 
    the interval does not change sign 

absolute_error = abs(interval b - interval a)
iterations = 1

while (iterations <= maximum number of iterations) and (absolute_error > tolerance)
    midpoint = (interval a + interval b) / 2
    show row of the tables

    if f(midpoint)==0 then
        solution found in midpoint
        break

    if f(interval a)*f(midpoint)<0 then
        interval b = midpoint
        previous midpoint = interval a
    else then
        interval a = midpoint
        previous midpoint = interval b

    absolute_error = abs(previous midpoint - midpoint)

    if absolute_error < tolerance the 
        solution found in midpoint with iterations
        break

    iterations = iterations + 1

if iterations > maximum number of iterations then 
    solution not found for that tolerance
